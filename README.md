// If you scroll too far in the detail screen and the list screen has not loaded those "far" item yet, the animation will not play when you navigate back. I find it pretty hard to fix this since
pre-loading too many items ahead will go against the idea of Lazy Components or Recycler View and it will affect performance.

// Thank you for your notice.
